                My name is Matt (in Finnish, Matti) and I’m a 30 year old 4th year computer science student at the University of Oulu who loves coding and solving problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been programming for about 8 years mainly in Python, but I also have experience with Java, JavaScript/Node, C, C++ and, recently, Rust. My personal projects span a variety of areas, including browser-based games, shell scripting applications, web scraping tools and simulations of physics based systems. I have extensively used git for version control in both school and personal projects and I’m proficient with the command line on both Windows and Linux systems. Additionally, I have experience with SQL, mainly SQLite, and have learned the fundamentals of software engineering, including Agile methodologies like SCRUM. Recently, I have started learning React and TypeScript to enhance my frontend development skills via the web-based Fullstack Open course. Beyond programming, I have worked briefly as a carpenter which improved my ability to work with my hands as well as to plan and execute practical projects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently doing my bachelors thesis on the topic of edge computer vision, where we are training and quantizing a YOLO model to run on a Google Coral TPU. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to be a part of developing digital products and services for the future. I believe that I can be of value because of my knowledge in programming and technology, my ability to learn new things and my positive attitude. As a worker I am eager for knowledge and experience, I like taking on new projects and I approach problems with organization and rationality. When working in a team I am a clear communicator, easygoing and approachable. I speak English fluently and Finnish at a high level. It is important to me that my work is engaging, challenging and improves my skills and knowledge in the field of IT. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born in Botswana, Africa to a Finnish mother and a Scottish father and I was educated in an international school. I believe that my multicultural background can help me see things from a different perspective. In my free time I enjoy playing the guitar and I love playing sports, mainly basketball and volleyball. I also enjoy working on personal, creative projects, which range from video editing to 3d design and - of course - coding!
